\chapter{Conclusion}

\emph{WebSocket} offers new and exciting methods of developing applications and
pushes HTML applications in areas that have traditionally been filled by native
applications. The possibilities of real-time interaction and concurrent
manipulation of datasets by different clients necessitates technologies and
frameworks that allow conflict detection, resolution and support for offline
operations. This project demonstrates a simple method of achieving these goals
in a way that is easy to understand due to the use of modern web technologies
that blur the line between server and client code and change the way concurrency
is handled when writing networking code.
